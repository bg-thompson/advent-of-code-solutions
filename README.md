# My Advent of Code Solutions

Here are my solutions to the (annual) Advent of Code challenges.

## 2023 (Zig)
All solutions are in Zig, self-contained, and use only the std library.

## 2022 (Odin)
All solutions are in Odin, self-contained, and use only a small collection of core libraries.

## 2021 (C / Odin)
The first week of solutions are in C. The second week are in Odin. Pretty much everything is self contained, the only libs I used for C are standard ones like `stdio.h` or `string.h`, likewise for Odin.
